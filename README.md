# Crowd Behavior Analysis using Object Detection
*  This project was formalized while doing a research internship at Calcutta University Technology Campus, Kolkata. Under the supervision of Dr. Banani Saha.
*  This project aims at providing a behavioural analysis of crowds using object detection and modified clustering algorithm.
*  This repository contains code for object detection in live CCTV videos using Tensorflow Objct Detection API
*  Also the code for modified Kmeans CLustering Algorithm is provided.
